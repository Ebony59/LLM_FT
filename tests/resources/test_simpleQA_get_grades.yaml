      a gold target, and a list of predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either
      \"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\".\n\n\nFirst, I will give examples
      of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\nThe following are examples
      of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama''s
      children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha
      and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha,
      but I''m not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack
      Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they
      are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July
      4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers
      are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information
      in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts
      the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation,
      grammar, and order don''t matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible,
      provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no
      incorrect information or contradictions.\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT
      predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama''s children?\nGold
      target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia,
      Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted
      answer 4: I think it''s either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie.
      Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don''t know their
      exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted
      answer 5: It''s possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should
      clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct
      answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama''s child is named
      James. However, it''s recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information
      since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most
      current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    -
      A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements
      that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i''m not sure,
      i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of
      NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack
      Obama''s children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don''t
      know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking
      about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this
      question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted
      answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but
      I''m not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED
      because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included
      in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso
      note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is
      a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the two significant figure
      in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does
      the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers
      \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\"
      and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more
      than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict
      the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question.
      In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that
      is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode
      did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey''s Anatomy?\" with gold target
      \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or
      \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted
      answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    -
      For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\"
      and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San
      Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    -
      Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer''s guide to training data:
      Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win
      at NAACL ''24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted
      answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\"
      is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of
      Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer
      \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    -
      For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama''s wife?\", the gold target
      is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered
      CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in
      people''s name if it''s clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold
      target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers
      as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere
      is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED.
      Don''t apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying
      to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: During what year did Pipilotti Rist receive
      the Premio 2000 prize?\nGold target: 1997\n```\n\nGrade each of the predicted
      answer of this question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust
      return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", for each answer."},{"role":"user","content":"There

    body: '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"Your job is to look at a question,
      a gold target, and a list of predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either
      \"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\".\n\n\nFirst, I will give examples
      of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\nThe following are examples
      of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama''s
      children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha
      and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha,
      but I''m not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack
      Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they
      are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July
      4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers
      are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information
      in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts
      the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation,
      grammar, and order don''t matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible,
      provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no
      incorrect information or contradictions.\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT
      predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama''s children?\nGold
      target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia,
      Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted
      answer 4: I think it''s either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie.
      Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don''t know their
      exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted
      answer 5: It''s possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should
      clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct
      answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama''s child is named
      James. However, it''s recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information
      since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most
      current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    -
      A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements
      that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i''m not sure,
      i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of
      NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack
      Obama''s children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don''t
      know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking
      about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this
      question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted
      answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but
      I''m not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED
      because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included
      in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso
      note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is
      a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the two significant figure
      in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does
      the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers
      \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\"
      and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more
      than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict
      the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question.
      In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that
      is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode
      did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey''s Anatomy?\" with gold target
      \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or
      \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted
      answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    -
      For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\"
      and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San
      Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    -
      Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer''s guide to training data:
      Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win
      at NAACL ''24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted
      answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\"
      is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of
      Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer
      \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    -
      For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama''s wife?\", the gold target
      is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered
      CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in
      people''s name if it''s clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold
      target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers
      as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere
      is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED.
      Don''t apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying
      to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Which year was Bil Keane''s first syndicated
      strip, Channel Chuckles, launched?\nGold target: 1954\n```\n\nGrade each of
      the predicted answer of this question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC:
      NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", for each answer."},{"role":"user","content":"There
